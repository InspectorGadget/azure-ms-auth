# Microsoft Authentication Flow (Single Sign On)

This implementation is the initial iteration as a part of the learning curve that i have set for myself. However, please feel free to fork this repository and improve the implementation as needed.

## Features
* Supports Microsoft Entra ID Applications (Created from App Registration Page).
* Provides login, validation the user and retrieving the User's account information.

*NOTE*: This implementation is far from being completed and basic. This implementation should serve as a guideline.
